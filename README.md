# Research Portfolio

I am a multidisciplinary researcher with a background in philosophy, politics, economics, and data science. My work examines pressing global challenges, including ethical AI governance, climate justice, migration policy, and systemic digital inequalities. By integrating theoretical frameworks with varied research methods, I aim to contribute to interdisciplinary research that supports equitable policy development and practical applications.

## Research Skills
- **Statistical Analysis:** Regression modelling, principal component analysis (PCA), and statistical correlation techniques.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Critical discourse analysis, thematic analysis, and user interface critiques to evaluate systems and platforms.
- **Data Collection:** Automated network scraping using bots (e.g., for Instagram data collection) and survey design for primary data gathering.
- **Data Processing:** Distributed data processing using Apache Spark to efficiently handle large datasets.
- **Programming and Analytical Tools:** Advanced skills in Python, R, and SQL for data analysis, modelling, and visualisation.
- **Visualisation Tools:** Proficient in Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, Power BI, Gephi, and Shiny (R) for creating narrative-driven visualisations.
- **Cloud and Collaboration Tools:** Experience with Microsoft Azure for cloud-based research and GitHub for version control in collaborative projects.
- **Academic and Mathematical Documentation:** Skilled in LaTeX for professional academic writing and MathType for mathematical expressions.
- **Research Communication:** Effective at delivering high-impact presentations and translating technical findings for academic, professional, and general audiences.

## Key Research Projects
### Algorithmic Bias and Digital Colonialism: Implications for Marginalised Communities
- Investigated systemic biases in content moderation algorithms, focusing on their disproportionate impact on Palestinian digital activism.
- Conducted critical discourse analysis of algorithmic decision-making frameworks and platform policies.
- Delivered frameworks for practical implementation in ethical AI governance and bias mitigation.

### To What Extent Are the West's Selective Borders Instruments of Inequality?
- Quantified systemic racial and economic biases in Western border selectivity using statistical correlation studies and regression analysis.
- Contextualised findings within postcolonial theories, linking border practices to global inequity.

### Inequality at Scale
- Analysed systemic disparities in Instagram networks, using automated bots for data extraction and network analysis with Python and Gephi.
- Highlighted structural inequalities in connectivity, revealing patterns of privilege and exclusion.

### Digital Love, Algorithmic Power: A Critical Analysis of Hinge’s Platform Economy
- Delivered a distinction-awarded presentation on Hinge’s data collection and algorithmic systems, critiquing the commodification of relationships.
- Proposed ethical frameworks for platform economies, integrating theories of digital labour and datafication.

### Privacy, Pornography, and AI: A Multidisciplinary Exploration
- Investigated the ethical and societal implications of generative AI technologies, focusing on deepfakes and their misuse to perpetuate harm.
- Combined feminist legal theory with harm-based ethics to recommend balanced regulatory interventions.

### Determining the Convergence of Climate Ethics Principles
- Evaluated climate accountability through polluter-pays, ability-to-pay, and beneficiary-pays principles.
- Applied PCA and regression analysis to highlight disparities in global emissions responsibility, emphasising inequities in international policy frameworks.
